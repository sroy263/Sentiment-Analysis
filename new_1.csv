India?s defining moment ? the day it freed itself completely from the shackles of colonialism to become a truly sovereign state ? had arrived three years after it gained independence.', 'Between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, the Dominion of India was a constitutional monarchy, with its King still being George VI and two Governor Generals (not Viceroys any longer): Lord Mountbatten (1947-48) and C Rajagopalachari (1948-50). Jawaharlal Nehru held office as Secretary for State (the head of government) of the Union of India throughout this period and governed the country through the Government of India Act (1935).', 'During this gradual transition phase, the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly (also the interim parliament in this period) was hard at work drafting a constitution for the infant country in the backdrop of lawlessness and bloodshed of the Partition and the beginning of the Kashmir conflict, Mahatma Gandhi?s assassination in 1948 and the complex political integration of 565 princely states with India. Nevertheless, in 1949, the Constituent Assembly finished drafting the world?s longest constitution with a solid foundation of justice, liberty, equality, unity, integrity and democracy as its leading values.', 'A historic session of the Constituent Assembly was held at the Central Hall of the Parliament House where the Constitution was passed with loud cheering and thumping of desks.', 'Before the motion and draft Constitution was passed, Dr Rajendra Prasad, the then President of the Constituent Assembly, said:', 'It was decided that India would become a truly sovereign state on 26 January 1950, the date chosen for its significance in history when in 1930, the Indian National Congress decided to demand for Purna Swaraj: complete freedom from the British.', 'Two days before the big day, on 24 January, at a special session of the Constituent Assembly, Dr Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of independent India. Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhai Patel became the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister while the Constituent Assembly assumed the role of Nehru?s Central Cabinet.Jana Gana ManaandVande Mataramofficially became the national anthem and song of the country on this day as well. All the cabinet members signed the Constitution, with Dr Rajendra Prasad choosing to do so last and at the very bottom, with a small scribble below Nehru?s name and a line of text.', 'Last round of preparations for the celebrations of the first Republic Day were set in motion, rehearsals for which had begun since 7 January. On 25 January, the first Indonesian President, Sukarno, arrived in Delhi, warmly greeted by his close friend and ally, Nehru and C Rajagopalachari. He was to be the first Chief Guest at the celebration; a natural fit given the similarity of his ideals with Nehru?s? of democracy and secularism? and the interminable cultural links between the two countries, going back to the time of the Mahabharata.', 'On Nehru?s request, Delhi University had organised a special convocation to confer an honorary PhD on Sukarno. One moment to be remembered from this ceremony was the riveting role reversal between two of Asia?s charismatic leaders. It was common practice for Nehru to conclude his speeches by shouting Jai Hind. Then, he would say ?Louder!? and the crowd would satisfy his demand.', 'PB Venkata Subramaniam, former Law Secretary, was studying law in the University at that time. Reminiscing about the function, he told V Suryanarayan writing forSouth Asian Analysis, quoting William Wordsworth: ?Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to have been young was very heaven.?', 'Dr Rajendra Prasad stood in a brilliantly lit, high-domed circular Durbar Hall in Government House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) delivering a speech, first in Hindi and then in English, shortly after taking oath as India?s first President, replacing the King as India?s head of state. He had spent the morning paying his respects to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat.', 'Six minutes earlier, at 10:18 AM, the last Governor General, C Rajagopalachari, had officially proclaimed India, that is Bharat, to be a Sovereign, Democratic Republic.', '?Let us begin with offering our thanks to the Almighty Power that has enabled us to see this day, to the Father of the Nation who showed us and to the world at large his infallible method ofSatyagrahaand led us on along it to freedom and to the numberless men and women, whose suffering and sacrifice have rendered the attainment of Independence and establishment of this sovereign democratic republic possible,? he continued smilingly with folded hands, in a blackachkan, whitechuridarand a Gandhi cap.', 'Inside the Durbar Hall, Nehru was the first to get up from his seat after Dr Prasad?s speech and shake hands with Sardar Vallabhbhai patel. Together, they walked up to the dais and congratulated Dr Prasad. Over 500 guests had assembled in the hall, including President Sukarno and his wife, several members of Diplomatic corps, members of the Constituent Assembly, the outgoing Governor General, C Rajagopalachari, Cabinet Ministers, Supreme Court Judges, the Auditor-General of India and other prominent citizens.', 'Nehru and other Cabinet members were sworn-in soon after. The Speaker of Lok Sabha, G V Mavalankar, the first Speaker, sat in the front row. For the first time, the national emblem of the Ashoka Pillar with three lions was placed near the throne of former British Viceroys. A statute of Lord Buddha was placed behind the throne. Unlike the one-day holiday we have come to know, a two-day national holiday was declared as a part of the celebration.', 'At India House in London, V K Krishna Menon, the Indian High Commissioner too proclaimed India as a Sovereign, Democratic Republic in front of Indian servicemen, students and revolutionaries living in the UK, after which he took an oath of allegiance: ?On this day when India becomes a sovereign democratic republic, I send my warmest greetings to all my countrymen abroad. In the long and eventful annals of our country, this day will have a special place. The Pledge taken long ago is fulfilled and every Indian wherever he may be has a new status as a citizen of a republic. This brings new rights...to live as free men and women.?', 'The dignified part of the celebrations were over; the revelry was set to begin.', 'Rajpath has become synonymous with Republic Day celebrations 68 years since, that majestic boulevard that runs from the Rashtrapati Bhavan through Vijay Chowk to India Gate. But it was not the venue of the first celebrations in 1950. Beyond India Gate lay, Irwin Amphitheatre (now Major Dhyanchand National Stadium), named after a former Viceroy where 15,000 people had gathered for the big parade, still nascent compared to the gala it is today.', 'The new President took a slow, ceremonial ride from Rashtrapati Bhavan with President Sukarno to the amphitheatre in a 35-year-old open state coach bearing the Ashoka Emblem. It was drawn by six Australian horses along the five-mile road to the Amphitheatre, escorted by the President?s bodyguards.', 'The roads were lined with exuberant crowds with the tricolour in their hands, cheering and chanting ?Jai? joined by those peering from neighbouring building roofs and treetops. Dr Prasad greeted them all with his hands folded and a modest but beaming smile.', 'His arrival at the amphitheatre was marked by a resounding 31-gun salute, solemnising the event as a milestone in India?s ?chequered history?: Our first Republic Day celebrations as an independent nation.', 'Dr Prasad proceeded to take a round of the amphitheatre, this time in a jeep, while saluting the 3,000 armed forces that had gathered there, after which he hoisted the tricolour, our national flag for the very first time. Another memorable speech by him was in the offing.', 'Four Param Vir Chakras, India?s highest gallantry awards, were awarded to soldiers for their bravery during the Kashmir Operation in 1947-48, two of which wereposthumous. The Armed Forces then put on a grand parade for all to see, after which the crowd sang the national anthem and dispersed.', 'The whole event was over in slightly above two hours. There were no performances or elaborate tableaus that we have come to know of today. Very few policemen guarded the VIPs inside the stadium who mingled with each other and the crowds, especially Nehru who reportedly spent close to half an hour interacting with the commonfolk.', 'Across India?s small towns and villages,prabhat pheries,or morning rounds where people came together to chant songs before the sun rose to invoke good vibrations for a new day, were organised.', 'Outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, amidst booming cheers by jubilant pools of people dressed in their finest, who had come to take part in the celebrations from adjoining states, the capital city had an air of festivity. People congratulated each other in the streets, raised slogans of ?Gandhiji ki Jai? and ?Vande Mataram? and visited Rajghat, the resting place of Mahatma Gandhi, in thousands.', 'Nearby, in Connaught Place, people of all age groups thronged the streets and crowded restaurants; shops remained illuminated through the day while the Rashtrapati Bhavan lit up at night, marking yet another first of a custom followed till this day. The atmosphere was electric and the spirit of freedom, infectious. India was the first Commonwealth country to have entirely come into its own; it was the biggest national ceremony of the 20th century.', 'Not all was good as there were several reports of anti-Republic Day celebrations from various regions across India. In Calcutta, communists attacked police officers with bombs and in Bombay, they protested that the workers? rights had been ignored in the constitution. In Hyderabad, there was an attempt to assassinate the Nizam, and in the capital city itself, the navy almost walked out of the parade!', 'Under the sea-faring British Empire, the navy was understandably the foremost of the three Armed Forces. Today, it can be argued that the honour lies with the army but in 1950, it was still a matter of contention. During the rehearsals for the first parade, the Navyfound itselfplaced after the last and comparatively huge contingent of the Army. When they protested, they were not taken seriously.', 'Until one day, during a routine rehearsal closer to 26 January, the Lt Commander and officer-in-charge of the Navy Contingent, Inder Singh, ordered the troops to march off the ground in protest. Chaos ensued and within fifteen minutes, senior army forces including the then Brigadier arrived at Irwin Amphitheatre to request the Navy to rejoin the parade, but this time in the lead. The offer was accepted, and that?s where the Navy marched on the final day.', 'From 1955 onwards, the venue of the celebrations was shifted to Rajpath, giving birth to an increasingly spectacular ceremony that remains a defining moment in the lives of all Indians each year, an event of national pride that displays the might and diversity of India: the Republic Day parade as we know it now.', 'It can be argued that the values encapsulated in the Constitution have eroded significantly in today?s political and cultural environment, in which case we need only look back at Dr Prasad?s words at the Irwin Amphitheatre 68 years ago for a glimmer of hope and rejuvenated enthusiasm: ?We must re-dedicate ourselves on this [Republic] day to the peaceful but sure realisation of the dream that had inspired the father of our nation and the other captains and soldiers of our freedom struggle, the dream of establishing a classless, co-operative, free and happy society. We must remember that this is more a day of dedications than of rejoicing ? dedication to the glorious task of making the peasants and workers, the toilers and the thinkers fully free, happy and cultured.?', '(We Indians have much to talk about these days.

Trump said of a meeting with Mueller, which he suggested may happen in about two to three weeks. He told reporters at the White House Wednesday that ?I would love to do it? and ?I would do it under oath? even though his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton wasn?t sworn in when she was interviewed in 2016 over her use of private emails as secretary of state.', 'Even if Mueller wraps up the obstruction probe, other elements of his investigation -- such as whether Trump or anyone close to him helped Russia interfere in the 2016 presidential election or broke any other laws -- are likely to continue for months more, said two officials who asked to remain anonymous speaking about the probe.', '?There?s no collusion whatsoever,?

It was there, Comey told lawmakers last year, that Trump told Sessions and others to leave the room and then asked Comey to ease up on investigating Flynn.', 'Mueller also has been investigating an attempt by Trump to pressure Coats and Rogers last year to get the FBI to back off of probing into Flynn, the two U.S. officials said. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators and has become a cooperating witness in Mueller?s probe.', 'Trump also told reporters that he doesn?t remember asking then-FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe whom he voted for in the 2016 presidential election shortly after Comey was fired.

He said the biggest concern for Trump in an interview is probably the risk of committing perjury, as Mueller will cross-check his comments and recollection against the testimony and evidence he?s obtained from Coats, Comey, Flynn, Sessions and others.', '?He wants to hear Trump?s side of the story,? Twardy said. ?It will be important for him to look at Trump?s state of mind.?', 'Instead of pursuing criminal charges, Mueller could refer any findings to the Republican-controlled Congress, where a number of inquiries are under way.', 'But as Mueller?s probe has closed in on Trump, his Republican allies -- especially on the House Intelligence Committee -- have amplified their attacks on the FBI and the Russia investigation that Trump has often dismissed as a ?witch hunt.?

The push is the first of a package of programs, including a long-awaited property tax, poised to unfold over several years to rein in one of the world?s wildest real estate markets.', '?China?s property market is on the brink of tremendous change,?\xa0said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.\xa0?The push for rental properties shows a new model is starting to emerge.?', 'Xi is leveraging his immense power to try to solve a problem that?s dogged policy makers around the globe: spiraling property prices in major metropolitan areas that have fueled rising inequality. The aim seems to be a new market model, somewhere between the capitalist frenzy that sent home prices in Shanghai and Beijing rocketing ever higher and the Communist system where dwellings were allocated by work units.', 'Establishing a vibrant rental market will help to defuse the risks from ?irrational? home prices, said Deng Yongheng, of the University of Wisconsin, who helped carry out a study that showed a 1,538 percent gain in land prices in Beijing from 2004 to 2016.\xa0The long-term effects could range from driving consolidation among developers to fueling consumer spending as people pay less for housing, Wang Tao, an economist for UBS Group AG, wrote Thursday.', 'Around China, large rental complexes are being completed, under construction or in planning, and funding for such projects is being made available.\xa0The changes may alter developers? businesses, shake up government revenue and help make more Chinese citizens, like Germans, renters for life.', 'In theory, a thriving rental market would add housing supply and help stabilize prices after a 13-year property rally. The old model that prioritized home ownership encouraged ?a lot of speculation and crazy price gains -- and that model is coming to an end,? said Rosealea Yao, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.', 'City governments from Beijing to Shanghai have earmarked public land to auction to property companies that would develop rental projects only. Country Garden Holdings Co., China?s largest developer by sales, has announced plans to make 1 million units available over three years. Banks are offering credit lines to developers for financing rental projects, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange is encouraging the creation of investment products backed by rental income.', 'Xi is trying to alter the popular belief that property is a one-way bet, since any short-lived declines in prices have inevitably been followed by booms. Homeownership rates in China are among the highest in the world, at almost 90 percent, according to Cushman and Wakefield Inc. People also buy young.

First, China?s leaders have to ensure they?re able to tame the market without tanking home prices. They?ll also have to balance other underlying drivers pointing to slowing demand. And officials would need to drop an old habit of letting prices boom whenever the economy needs a boost.', 'Still, the government?s backing means that the size of China?s rental market could drive annual rental payments to 4.2 trillion yuan ($658 billion) by 2030, almost half of total home sales in 2017, according to estimates from Orient Securities Co.', 'Here are some of the steps taken by cities, developers and others to support the push:', 'Some 95 percent of 395 units offered in the initial phases have been rented mostly to individuals under 32, said Vanke?s Shanghai head for rental business Yan Yong, with rents ranging from 2,600 to 3,400 yuan a month ($407 to $532).\xa0Not bad for a city where home costs have soared to levels rivaling theworld?s priciestmarket, Hong Kong.', 'While analysts say it could take years for the changes to take hold, some caution against underestimating the resolve of Xi, perhaps China?s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.', 'Read more: A QuickTake explainer on China?s housing market', '?When Xi started his anti-graft campaign years ago, people didn?t expect it to be so powerful, but it proved to be beyond imagination,? said Mizuho?s Shen. ?Now, most people still hold the belief that home prices will never fall, and speculation is rampant.

A special counsel is granted a level of independence and autonomy to lead investigations of politically sensitive, nationally important matters. But the position isn?t untouchable.', 'It?s a lawyer from outside of government named by the attorney general to take over an investigation that poses a conflict of interest for the Justice Department.

Rosenstein?s boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself from overseeing the inquiry.', 'Technically correct, and only upon finding ?misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest"" or ""other good cause.? Rosenstein has said,as recently as Dec. 13, that he sees no such reason to dismiss Mueller. Short of firing the special counsel, Rosenstein could reel in the investigation by finding one of more of its strategies or techniques ""so inappropriate or unwarranted under established departmental practices that it should not be pursued."" But Rosenstein has given no indication that he?s contemplating this step, either.', 'Yes, since a president?s power over the executive branch is vast.\xa0Last June, Trump wanted to fire Mueller, according to three people familiar with the matter. The New York Times reported that White House counsel Donald McGahn refused to pass that order to the Justice Department and threatened to resign. Another option -- which Trump also considered, according to the Times -- would be to fire Rosenstein and pressure his successor to dismiss Mueller, repeating the steps as needed until finding someone willing to carry out his wishes. (A firing and a pair of resignations touched off by President Richard Nixon during the late stages of the Watergate investigation went down in history as the ""Saturday Night Massacre."") Or Trump could fire Sessions, with the expectation that Sessions? successor would seize control of the case from Rosenstein -- and fire Mueller. Under yet another scenario,offeredby the author of the special-counsel regulations, Trump could order their repeal, then fire Mueller by himself.', 'Not necessarily. The investigation predated Mueller?s appointment as special counsel and already has some prosecutions underway. If Mueller were to be dismissed, much would depend on his successor -- who would, presumably, be appointed by Rosenstein.', 'Yes, but without much legislative progress. Senators Thom Tillis, a Republican, and Chris Coons, a Democrat, proposed a bill establishing that a fired special counsel would be reinstated if a panel of judges finds no good cause for the removal. Two other senators,\xa0Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Cory Booker, offered a bill that would require the attorney general or acting attorney general to get approval from a three-judge panel before firing a special counsel.

Shares of Altria Group Inc., which has a U.S. licensing agreement for iQos, briefly fell 5.5 percent and ended down 2.3 percent at $69.91.', '?We are confident in our ability to address the valid questions raised by the committee with the FDA as the review process for our application continues,? said Philip Morris spokesman Corey Henry in an emailed statement.', 'Altria didn?t immediately respond to a request for comment.', 'The panel was largely unconvinced that Philip Morris presented enough data, particularly in humans as opposed to rats, to prove a reduction in exposure to harmful chemicals from iQos would shrink smokers? risk of developing diseases such as cancer that are linked to tobacco use.', '?I don?t see a whole host of studies,? Michael Weitzman, an advisory panel member and professor in the Department of Pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine, said before the vote. ?I feel very uncomfortable making the judgment call. What we?ve seen -- it suggests, it implies. I could not say under oath that what we?ve seen demonstrates.?', 'The FDA will consider the panel?s recommendations as the agency weighs whether to grant Philip Morris its request to designate iQos a ?modified risk tobacco product,? meaning it will benefit the health of the population as a whole. The designation would allow Philip Morris to market iQos as less risky than cigarettes and be the first such label granted by the FDA. The agency isn?t bound by the opinion of the advisory panel.', 'Despite the volatile stock-market reaction, some analysts weren?t surprised by the panel?s vote.', '?Our going-in assumption was that Philip Morris and Altria would face a tough audience of scientists who generally have an anti-tobacco bias,? Vivien Azer, a Cowen & Co. analyst who covers the tobacco industry, said in a note. ?The initial stock reactions seemed excessive.?', 'Azer was expecting the panel to want more research, she said.', 'IQos includes an electronic heater and a heat stick which resembles a short cigarette. Users insert the stick into the heater and draw on the stick, which has been warmed to almost 600 degrees Fahrenheit. A cigarette burns at more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the heat levels, the more harmful chemicals users are exposed to, according to Philip Morris.', 'FDA staff raised questions about iQos in a report prepared for the meeting, highlighting that a full Philip Morris study on the device?s cancer-causing potential wouldn?t come until later this year. While iQos reduced exposure to some harmful chemicals compared with smoking, users could still develop certain precancerous lesions similar to those that can be caused by traditional cigarettes, according to the staff report.', 'Altria will sell iQos in the U.S. under a licensing agreement if the FDA clears it for sale, which is a separate application from the one Philip Morris submitted to make claims that it is less risky than smoking. The FDA is expected to act on the application to sell early this year; it doesn?t have a timeline for making a decision on the relative risk of iQos.', 'Philip Morris estimates that 6 million of the 40 million smokers in the U.S. will make the switch to iQos if it is approved for sale, Antonio Ramazzotti, vice president of human insights and behavioral research at Philip Morris, said during the meeting.', '', '', '', '©2018 Bloomberg L.P.']",1/27/2018 12:28,/business/2018/01/25/high-tech-tobacco-gadget-hits-snag-in-push-to-disrupt-smoking,bloombergquint,"(Bloomberg) -- Philip Morris International Inc. failed to convince health experts that its tobacco-heating product reduces the risk of smoking-related disease, a setback that raises questions about whether potential cigarette alternatives are really safer than smoking.",[],Tobacco Device Hits Snag as Experts Question Disease Dangers

Business equipment investment grew at the fastest pace in three years.', 'While the report dashed expectations for the longest streak of 3 percent-or-better growth since 2005, a key measure of underlying demand delivered the strongest performance since 2014 and inflation picked up, which will help keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates in coming months.', 'President\xa0Donald Trump?s move to cut taxes may give the economy an additional boost in 2018, though reaching his goal of sustained 3 percent GDP growth will prove challenging, in part because household purchases are projected to cool.

Businesses are investing aggressively and consumers continue to spend at a very strong pace. We got a bit spoiled by 3 percent-plus growth in the last couple of quarters, but that streak was eventually going to come to an end.?', 'Fourth-quarter GDP was dragged down mainly because the trade deficit widened, as imports rose at double the pace of exports.

Such sales grew 4.3 percent last quarter, the most since 2014, after a 1.9 percent increase.', 'For the full year, GDP, the value of all goods and services produced, grew 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the Commerce Department report also showed.

The expansion is now in its ninth year and is poised to become the country?s second-longest on record later in 2018.', 'Fourth-quarter GDP growth forecasts ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.8 percent, according to the Bloomberg survey.

All told, Dell had around $48.5 billion of bonds and loans as of Nov. 3. Before it went private in 2013, it had less than $7 billion of debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.', 'Now changes to U.S. corporate tax law could make it more expensive for some corporations to borrow, including Dell, and boost other expenses. That?s painful for a company that?s already losing money.\xa0Taking steps such as going public again would help the company raise equity and pay down debt. Dell spokesman Dave Farmer declined to comment.', '?Tax reform threw them a curveball,? said Jordan Chalfin, an analyst at CreditSights. ?It put a wrench in their deleveraging plans.?', 'Under the new law, Dell can only deduct interest expenses equal to about 30 percent of a measure of its income.

In late November, Dell was among companies thatsigned onto a letter to Senate leaders opposing a stricter version of the deduction limitation than what ultimately become law.', 'Tax law changes could hit the company in another way too: Dell has to pay taxes on cash and other assets held overseas, which could amount to around $6 billion over time, starting with about $480 million for each of the first five years, according to estimates from CreditSights analysts led by Chalfin.', 'Dell said on an analyst call last month when it released earnings that it will not comment on the impacts of the new tax law but that it expects them to be manageable. The company has about $3 billion of bonds maturing this year, and another $4.35 billion in 2019, not to mention the more than $2 billion of loans coming due over that period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.', 'Rising interest rates over time may weigh on its interest expenses, too. Around $12.9 billion of the company?s loans as of November 3 were tied to the floating rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. That rate has gone up 92 basis points since the EMC deal closed, effectively adding more than $115 million to Dell?s annual interest expense, if the company did not hedge that risk. The company has been mitigating that extra expense by negotiating lower rates on some of its loans.', 'One other key factor: the Dell buyout was partially funded by private equity firm Silver Lake, which put up additional money to help pay for the EMC acquisition, bringing its total stake to around $2.4 billion. That firm may be looking to get out, said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA.

Japanese finance ministry officials said on Monday that the country will conduct on-site inspections of exchanges and that cryptocurrencies would likely become an issue at the next G-20 meeting.', 'While Bitcoin and its ilk have rebounded from their selloff on Friday -- thanks in part to Coincheck?s assurances over the weekend that customers would be partially reimbursed -- market observers said concerns over security lapses are likely to persist.
