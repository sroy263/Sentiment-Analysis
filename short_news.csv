That?s a contrast to some Android phone makers that havecomplained openlyabout the proposal. Apple declined to comment.', 'Apple isn?t complaining because a Broadcom acquisition of Qualcomm would probably save the iPhone maker billions of dollars in licensing fees while posing risks for Apple?s key smartphone competitors.', 'In what would be a clear boon to Apple, Broadcom plans to close Qualcomm?s licensing business over time because it causes too much friction with customers, according to people familiar with its plans.', 'For years, Qualcomm was the sole provider of modem chips for iPhones and iPads, but nowadays Apple is designing more of its own components, making the companies more like rivals than supply chain partners.', 'Qualcomm also charges Apple and other phone makers\xa0license fees from patents covering the fundamentals of all modern handsets. The levy, a percentage of the price of each device sold, has been Qualcomm?s main source of profit and costs Apple about $2 billion a year, analysts estimate.', 'Apple stopped paying last year and accused Qualcomm of illegally using its dominance in cell phone chips to demand inflated licensing fees. Once in control, Broadcom could save Apple money by ending those fees.', '?They think it?s done. They want to get rid of licensing,? said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C.

In China, that premium position has been\xa0eroded by Android-based local phone makers like Oppo and Vivo, that rely heavily on Qualcomm chips. The competition from Qualcomm-dependent rivals lessens the value of Apple?s component designs and creates more tension with Qualcomm.', 'Qualcomm is ?lowering the innovation that vendors in the Android ecosystem have to put in, so they?re making it easier to compete with Apple,"" Milanesi said. ?Qualcomm invests a lot in innovation and driving things forward, which creates more of a competition for what Apple is doing in chips.?', 'Broadcom executives plan to reduce spending on R&D to 15 percent of revenue from about 19 percent. An independent Qualcomm wants to splurge almost a quarter of sales on R&D. That equals about $5.5 billion a year invested by Qualcomm, compared with about $3.2 billion at Broadcom.', 'While Broadcom spends less than Qualcomm, the budget is heavily focused on improving its Wi-Fi chips and other components where it currently dominates, according to Broadcom Chief Technical Officer Henry Samueli.', 'That?s less threatening than Qualcomm?s R&D efforts, which often take it into new territory where Apple is investing heavily, too.
